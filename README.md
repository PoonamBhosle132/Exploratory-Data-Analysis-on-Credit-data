Objective : 


This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics - understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough.

Goals of the case study: 

Identify the missing data and use appropriate method to deal with it. (Remove columns/or replace it with an appropriate value)

Identify if there are outliers in the dataset. Also, mention why do you think it is an outlier. Again, remember that for this exercise, it is not necessary to remove any data points.

Identify if there is data imbalance in the data. Find the ratio of data imbalance.

Explain the results of univariate, segmented univariate, bivariate analysis, etc. in business terms.

Find the top 10 correlation for the Client with payment difficulties and all other cases (Target variable).

Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation. You are free to choose the graphs which explain the numerical/categorical variables. Insights should explain why the variable is important for differentiating the clients with payment difficulties with all other cases.
